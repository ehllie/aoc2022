# Ellie's Haskell [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
I chose to write my projects in Haskell since I don't often get to use it professionally, even though it's a lovely language.

Project is built with nix, so to run the solution for puzzle `XX`, run: 
```console
$ nix shell github:ehllie/aoc2022 -c aocXX
```
